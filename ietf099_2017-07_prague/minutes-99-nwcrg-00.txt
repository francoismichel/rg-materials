00- Welcome, administrative and general matters. Goals of this meeting (Vincent Roca)


PART I: Use-cases where end-to-end coding or network coding can be beneficial
=============================================================================

NC for satellite communications
-------------------------------
 
01- "Network coding and satellites" (Nicolas Kuhn, CNES, and Emmanuel Lochin (ISAE), remote)
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-01-kuhn-network-coding-and-satellite-communications-02.pdf
	  
	Vincent Roca (VR): I appreciate your initiative in setting up this I-D and the effort made in collecting views/interests
		of different people. Having a design team for this topic is great.

	Marie Jose Montpetit (MJM): I have the feeling this I-D will just look at satellite links while in fact this link is
		part of Internet. Also, do you mean NC at the PHY layer or FEC at the PHY layer?
	Nicolas Kuhn and Emmanuel Lochin (NK&EL): Currently deployed system all use FEC at the PHY layer (DVB-* standards).
		But we do not want to focus only on PHY layer FEC coding, we consider more complex scenarios with multi-gateways,
		TCP split connections, etc. It goes well beyond PHY layer.

	Victor Firoiu (VF): thanks for the initiative. What are the research aspects in this work?
	NK&EL: yes, we want to provide a view of what solutions could be deployed, both on the experimental and research sides.
	VR: you could perhaps make it more explicit with a « research challenges » section.
	NK&EL: yes, in ICNRG there is a document specific to open research challenges and we could do the same here.


NC for ICN/CCN
--------------

02- "CCN and Network Coding" (Cedric Westphal)
        Also covers NetCodCCN (Infocom'16)
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-02-westphal-ccn-and-network-coding-00.pdf


03- "Low latency low loss streaming using in-network coding and caching" (Hitoshi Asaeda)
	(Infocom'17)
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-03-asaeda-low-latency-low-loss-streaming-using-in-network-coding-and-caching-00.pdf

	VR: Thomos Nikolaos sent me an email telling me he couldn't join today but volunteers to participate.
		Maybe it would make sense to try setting up a design team as with the « NC and satellite » topic.
	Presenters: agreed

	Allison Mankin (AM): it's probably meaningful to have a common template for both documents. Lots of aspects
		about why you are doing this and what are the components could be common.
	VR: agreed. There could be a generic part, common to all documents, and a use-case specific part.

	Hitoshi Asaeda (HA): the « research challenges » could be in a single document.

	Cedric Adjih (CA): I'm interested by the topic.


Other NC potential use-cases
----------------------------

04- "Some Network Coding Use Cases" (Vincent Roca, on behalf of Rolf Sperber (remote))

	Slides quickly presented by Vincent Roca (sorry for not being clear on what was expected).
	Lists potential a few domains for potential NC (high density sensors, train, vehicles, content storage).


05- "Generic Robust Low Latency Tunelling: proposal for a performance enhancing tunnel" (Marie-José Montpetit, remote) (10')
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-05-montpetit-generic-robust-low-latency-tunneling-a-proposal-for-a-performance-enhancing-tunnel-00.pdf

	VR: do you believe it is useful to do re-coding?
	MJM: it could be, but we didn't think about it yet.
	VR: what is a micro-flow?
	MJM: do we want a tunnel to be end-to-end, with all flows multiplexed into it, or do we want the tunnel to be aware
		of each individual flow (i.e., consider micro-flows)?
	VR: is there interest? I know there is Akamai, anybody else?  I (VR) am interested as individual. We will ask to the mailing list.

	VF: a little bit out of the initial charter, we did not thought about it so far, but very interesting.

	EL&NK: sounds more like a problem of network traffic engineering than network coding. 
	MJM: agreed. It is more putting NC into a traffic engineering toolkit. But as it implies the use of NC, it is related to this group.
		This work will not lead to new codes, of course. 
	NK&EL : there are other groups working specifically on tunnelling.
	MJM: agreed. If the group believes it is not related to NWCRG, maybe we could address it within a transport WG.
	Brandon Williams (BW): with respect to the network engineering aspects, the codes and their tuning directly impact the network quality
		and the quality of experience for the application. The tuning of codes for video would be different from the tuning for data
		transfers. The focus is on the tuning of the parameters and the negotiation of the aspects of the codes themselves that have an
		impact of network engineering.
	NK&EL: much clearer now and we understand the need for it.

	VR: let’s continue on the list.


PART II: On the coding side
===========================

Low complexity coding
---------------------

06- "Pyrit: Polynomial Ring Transforms for Fast Erasure Coding" (Jonathan Detchart)

	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-06_detchart_pyritpdf-01.pdf

	VR: thanks for making this presentation very understandable, skipping complex details.
	CA: you go from field to ring, operation, and go back from ring to field: is it isomorphic ?
	Jonathan Detchart (JD): not all operations are isomorphic, but they are homomorphic most of the time.
	CA: why don't you stay in the ring?
	JD: the representation in the ring is larger which finally creates problems. So you need to go back.

	Morten Pedersen (MP): very interesting. I’d like to know more about the transforms and their speed.
	JD: [details the two transforms] from the field to the ring, it's just a matter of adding a parity bit, and
		the reverse transform is about removing this bit.
	MP: reminds me of some work on optimal prime field where there was a mapping as well. I'm impressed by performance.


On the benefit of sliding window codes (network coding?) to IETF protocols
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

07- "Less Latency and Better Protection with AL-FEC Sliding Window Codes: a Robust Multimedia CBR Broadcast Case Study" (Vincent Roca)
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-07-roca-less-latency-and-better-protection-with-sliding-window-codes-a-robust-multimedia-cbr-broadcast-case-study-01.pdf

	somebody@Akamai: did you use Raptor or RaptorQ codes?
	VR: we used the "old" Raptor codes that are part of 3GPP MBMS standard. Anyway, Reed-Solomon are ideal
		codes and even with RaptorQ, you could not achieve better erasure recovery performance.

	MJM: have you have thought about other convolutional codes, or just sliding window?
	VR: we considered the simplest sliding window codes, those that are described in our TSVWG I-D.

	VF: very interesting. You considered fixed rate coding, but other protocols may also need dynamic rate adaptation, or others may
		stream content for ever until all receivers got the content (as with fountain codes).
	VR: we are not considering any dynamic adaptation in this work. This is a broadcast/multicast scenario, so there's necessarily a
		single stream for all receivers and you need to define all parameters in advance.
		But with a unicast scenario involving feedback messages, adding a dynamic adaptation of RLC parameters would not be a problem.


08- "FEC codes and QUIC" (Ian Swett)
	https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/99/slides/slides-99-nwcrg-08-swett-quic-fec-00.pdf

	MP: running FEC codes are no longer a problem, even on lightweight embedded platforms (e.g., smartphones).
		You'll find many works including ours confirming this.

	(somebody): if you want to test with sliding windows in QUIC, is there are a good starting point?
	IS: Going to the implementation would be the most easier approach. The Chromium one is pretty close to what we are using internally.
		It's C++, very fast, and recommended. There is another one but I don't know how up-to-date it is.

	NK&EL: we did not understood the CDF drawing. What is the QUIC window size?
	IS: It's essentially packet losses per window. The window size could be different across tests.
		It's not exactly what you are used for. The figure itself comes from 1 week of Google traffic.

	VR: I think this is a very important topic. Thanks to everybody and let’s continue on the list.
